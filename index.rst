Welcom to Coding with Kids!
=================================
Coding with kids can be a *great*
way to not only teach them som skills
that will help them with their
own lives, but also create or 
strenghthen som lasting
**bodnds between you and them.**

Throughout your journey you will
both likely learn new ``concepts`` and
``terms`` that wil expand your horizons and 
provide hours of enjoyment

.. note::
   some kids have problems with screen time
   and if you leave them unattended with a
   screen and they have access to things
   like YouTube or games, they my not stay
   focused on the task at hand.


There are lots of great options for
where to start,
and  :doc:`/Options/justlogic` is a great
place to start. Note that the 
:doc:`best starting point </Options/justlogic>`  is another way to refer
to the same place but give you link text some title

for detial about the hardware and code question
see :ref:`Options sectionf for hardware and code <hwcodeOptions>`
